# DAO Governance System: Final Analysis, Recommendations, and Gaps for Future Development

## Comprehensive Analysis Against Requirements

### Requirements Recap

1. **Non-Transferable Governance Token (SHLD)**: SHLD tokens should remain non-transferable and grant governance rights to holders.
2. **Centralized Proposal and Voting System**: DAO should support a structured proposal system and voting mechanism, with clear proposal lifecycle statuses (`Active`, `Passed`, `Rejected`).
3. **Cross-Chain Verification**: Use Aurora-based proof verification for MANA and collateral balances to ensure voting power accuracy.
4. **Project-Based Governance and Hierarchical Proposals**: Include support for project-based governance with hierarchical structures (projects, sub-projects, tasks) and MANA budgeting.
5. **Delegate Voting for Treasury Management**: Support a delegate system for treasury-related governance decisions, allowing SHLD holders to assign voting power.
6. **Future Cross-Chain Integration with Verus ID**: Plan for Verus ID integration post-hackathon for enhanced identity and cross-chain governance.

## Final Module Breakdown and Responsibilities

In line with the Sputnik DAO design, we maintain separate **ProposalModule** and **VotingModule** to provide consistency with existing systems while ensuring each module has a clear, non-overlapping role.

### 1. **SHLDContract**

- **Primary Responsibility**: Handle **non-transferable token issuance and ownership verification**.
- **Details**:
    - Manages SHLD token lifecycle (minting, non-transferability) to prevent transferability and maintain governance eligibility.
    - Determines eligibility for proposal creation and voting based on SHLD ownership.
- **Role in Governance**: Acts as a **permissions and governance eligibility layer** by confirming which accounts have SHLD tokens and can thus participate in governance actions.

### 2. **ProposalModule**

- **Primary Responsibility**: Manage **proposal creation, storage, and lifecycle** independently from voting results.
- **Details**:
    - Stores proposal details such as title, description, proposer, and status.
    - Tracks proposal lifecycle statuses (`Active`, `Passed`, `Rejected`) based on signals received from VotingModule.
    - Supports hierarchical structures for project-based governance (projects, sub-projects, epics, tasks) and proposal types (general, project, treasury).
- **Role in Governance**: Provides **structured proposal management** and metadata, ensuring a consistent proposal flow that feeds directly into VotingModule for voting actions.

### 3. **VotingModule**

- **Primary Responsibility**: Centralize **voting logic, result tallying, and proposal status updates** based on SHLD holder actions.
- **Details**:
    - Executes voting on proposals from ProposalModule, counting votes and updating proposal statuses based on results.
    - Incorporates cross-chain proof verification via Aurora to validate MANA and collateral balances, ensuring accurate voting power distribution.
    - Differentiates voting mechanisms based on proposal category, handling both general governance proposals and project-specific votes with clear procedures.
    - Implements delegate voting for treasury-specific governance to allow SHLD holders to assign voting power to council members for financial decisions.
- **Role in Governance**: Acts as the **voting execution and tallying hub**, providing a unified approach to governance decisions across various proposal types.

### 4. **GovernanceDataContract**

- **Primary Responsibility**: Store and verify **MANA balances, collateral, and voting power** for accurate governance decision-making.
- **Details**:
    - Maintains verified MANA balances, collateralized MANA, and voting power for each SHLD holder.
    - Supports VotingModule by providing validated data to ensure governance decisions reflect each holder’s true MANA-based power.
- **Role in Governance**: Functions as a **data provider for validated voting power**, backing VotingModule’s cross-chain data needs.

### 5. **mana_structs.rs**

- **Primary Responsibility**: Handle **project and task lifecycle tracking** for project-based governance.
- **Details**:
    - Defines hierarchical structures such as project plans, sub-projects, epics, and tasks with unified task status tracking (e.g., `Planned`, `InProgress`, `Completed`).
    - Tracks budget items and MANA allocations for projects, enabling transparency and accountability in project-based governance decisions.
    - Provides read-only access to VotingModule for project-related proposals, allowing the governance system to incorporate budgetary approvals.
- **Role in Governance**: **Project management and budgeting layer** that complements governance voting by tracking project details and milestones.

## Assessment: Meeting the Requirements

| Requirement                               | How It’s Addressed                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Non-Transferable Governance Token**     | Handled in **SHLDContract**, which manages SHLD token lifecycle, ensuring non-transferability and governance eligibility.          |
| **Centralized Proposal and Voting System** | Split across **ProposalModule** (proposal management) and **VotingModule** (voting and status updates) for clear governance flow.  |
| **Cross-Chain Verification**              | Managed in **VotingModule** via `ManaBalancesProof` and Aurora-based proof verification, ensuring voting power accuracy.          |
| **Project-Based Governance**              | **ProposalModule** structures proposals for projects, while **mana_structs.rs** handles task tracking and project milestones.     |
| **Delegate Voting for Treasury**          | Included in **VotingModule** for treasury-specific decisions, allowing SHLD holders to assign delegate voting rights to council.  |
| **Future Verus ID Integration**           | Planned for **post-hackathon expansion** in VotingModule to support cross-chain identity verification and governance.             |

## Final Recommendations

1. **Centralize Proposals in ProposalModule**:
    - Use ProposalModule to manage proposal creation, lifecycle, and hierarchical relationships.
    - Limit ProposalModule to proposal metadata and status tracking, with voting logic moved entirely to VotingModule.

2. **Voting and Validation in VotingModule**:
    - VotingModule should exclusively handle vote counting, status updating, and cross-chain proof verification.
    - Ensure distinct pathways within VotingModule for general proposals, project-based governance, and treasury voting.

3. **Delegate Voting Implementation**:
    - Integrate delegate voting into VotingModule, especially for treasury-specific governance, allowing flexibility in decision-making without compromising decentralized control.

4. **Project Lifecycle Tracking in mana_structs.rs**:
    - Use mana_structs.rs solely for project management, task tracking, and budget allocation, giving the DAO a transparent system for tracking project milestones independently from governance actions.

## Gaps for Future Development

1. **Verus ID Integration**:
    - **Gap**: Currently no Verus ID integration for post-hackathon cross-chain governance.
    - **Future Plan**: Expand VotingModule to support Verus ID for identity verification and cross-chain governance, ensuring secure participation across NEAR and Verus ecosystems.

2. **Enhanced Proposal Categorization**:
    - **Gap**: Limited support for categorizing proposals by type (e.g., general, project, treasury).
    - **Future Plan**: Integrate categorization fields in ProposalModule, allowing VotingModule to handle different governance rules based on proposal type, especially as new categories or decision types are added.

3. **Comprehensive Feedback System**:
    - **Gap**: Feedback and rating mechanisms for tasks and projects are minimal.
    - **Future Plan**: Expand task feedback functions in mana_structs.rs to gather peer reviews, ratings, and comments for tasks and proposals. This feedback can guide future governance decisions and improve project accountability.

This design ensures a modular, future-proof architecture that adheres to Sputnik DAO’s separation of proposals and voting, while aligning with your DAO’s unique requirements. Each module is optimized for scalability and modularity, with specific responsibilities that streamline governance actions and project tracking in a secure, decentralized framework.
