# README: Stakeholder Analysis Summary for MANA Ecosystem

This document summarizes the core analysis, recommendations, and stakeholder requirements for each component of the MANA ecosystem, emphasizing how they collectively meet cooperative governance goals.

---

## Overview of Components

The MANA ecosystem consists of four key contracts, each contributing to the decentralized governance framework:

1. **MANA (ERC-1400 Token)** – Represents cooperative capital, influencing governance.
2. **SHLD (Governance Token)** – Manages governance participation rights as a non-transferable token.
3. **FYRE (Collateralized Token)** – Provides a BTC-backed asset for purchasing SHLD and contributing to governance.
4. **Treasury Contract** – Oversees collateralized FYRE, exchange rates, and MANA minting based on cooperative votes.

## Detailed Analysis per Contract

### 1. **MANA Token**
   - **Objective**: Provides governance influence and represents member-contributed capital within the cooperative.
   - **Requirements Met**:
     - **Non-transferable Governance Voting**: Weighted governance influence linked to SHLD tokens.
     - **Transition of Mana (ERC-20) to MANA (ERC-1400)** for cooperative control.
     - **Treasury Management for Collateralized MANA** with verified backing.
   - **Recommendations**:
     - Centralize governance in **VotingModule** for clear separation of project and general governance.
     - **Lifecycle Transition**: A `contributeToCooperative` function to transfer `mana` to the Treasury, converting it into MANA tokens.

### 2. **SHLD Governance Token**
   - **Objective**: Defines governance eligibility for members through a non-transferable structure.
   - **Requirements Met**:
     - **Non-Transferable Governance Rights**: Ensures that only verified cooperative members participate in governance.
     - **Delegate and Council Voting** for treasury decisions.
     - **Cross-Chain Compatibility with Verus ID Integration** for identity validation and governance.
   - **Recommendations**:
     - Migrate proposal and voting logic to **ProposalModule** and **VotingModule**.
     - Integrate **Delegate Voting** for fiscal decision-making, enhancing treasury management efficiency.

### 3. **FYRE Token**
   - **Objective**: Acts as a collateralized token, allowing members to convert FYRE to SHLD or contribute it to governance.
   - **Requirements Met**:
     - **BTC Collateralization** for each FYRE token issued.
     - **Conversion of FYRE to SHLD and MANA** to influence cooperative governance.
     - **DAO-Controlled Minting** for fiscal transparency and security.
   - **Recommendations**:
     - Implement **DAO Governance Controls** for minting FYRE, tying it to approved projects.
     - **Enhanced Event Logging** for transactions, including minting and conversion, to maintain transparency.

### 4. **Treasury Contract**
   - **Objective**: Manages the minting, burning, and exchange rate setting for FYRE and MANA, serving as the cooperative’s fiscal management hub.
   - **Requirements Met**:
     - **Cross-Chain Proof Verification with NEAR** to validate member assets.
     - **SHLD Purchase Tracking** with event logging to ensure governance accountability.
     - **DAO-Controlled Exchange Rate Adjustments** for FYRE, SHLD, and MANA.
   - **Recommendations**:
     - Add **DAO-Driven Quotas** to control SHLD issuance and limit potential risks.
     - Expand **Cross-Chain Proof Compatibility** for flexible and secure governance participation across NEAR and Verus.

## Future Development Recommendations

1. **Verus ID Integration Across SHLD and FYRE and Collateralization Functions**: Essential for cross-chain governance and identity validation, allowing the cooperative to manage membership and voting rights seamlessly across networks.

2. **Centralize Voting Logic in VotingModule**: Ensures that MANA, SHLD, and FYRE align with governance, while VotingModule manages proposal statuses, counts votes, and executes status updates based on member voting.

3. **Project Lifecycle Tracking**: Enhance project management within **mana_structs.rs** by consolidating task tracking, budgeting, and milestone achievement.

## Summary

The MANA ecosystem supports a decentralized governance model, leveraging modular components to secure member participation, fiscal transparency, and project accountability. By focusing on improvements like cross-chain integration, centralized voting modules, and lifecycle transitions, the MANA ecosystem is primed for robust, future-proof cooperative governance.
